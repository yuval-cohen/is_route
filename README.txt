C program that determines whether there is a route between two cities.

The program receives:
1. an input file with a list of two cities in each line represents a route between them.
2. city A
3. city B
The program outputs whether there is a route (or isn't) between the two (based on the input file).

Assumptions:
(1) Each line is in the following format: <name><COMMA><name><NEW-LINE>
(2) no spaces
(3) New-line is '\n'
(4) no spaces in names, use hyphen instead (e.g. tel-aviv)
(5) names are case sensitive
(6) name length is limited to 30 characters
(7) A new line is required at the end of the file
